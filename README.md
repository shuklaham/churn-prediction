# churn-prediction
End to end machine learning project on churn prediction.

#### Problem statement
There is a telecom company that offers phone and internet services. There is a problem: some of our customers are churning. We would like to build a model that can identify the customers that are likely to churn. We have collected a dataset about our customers: what type of services they use, how much they paid, and how long they stayed with us. We also know who canceled their contracts and stopped using our services (churned). 
Data: [churn data](https://github.com/shuklaham/churn-prediction/blob/master/WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv)

#### Solution
I have followed ML project checklist inspired from the one mentioned in the book [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646) . I have divided my work into multiple short redable notebooks:
- Data preparation
- Data exploration
- Feature correlation and importance
- Evaluation metrics
- Model training
- Hyperparameter tuning and ensembles
- Final model selection, model saving and docker

I have used **Flask** to build web service.
